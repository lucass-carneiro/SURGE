2. *Indie (F) the Cabalist*: Keep on existing by isolating yourself with others like you. Do not make your presence known to your victims. Protect yourself from attacks by not being known and by using the strength of your peers if the need arises.
3. *Lalita (F) the Manipulator*: Keep on existing by convincing others you are a good monster. Make your victims accept your monstrous nature, and convince them that you are desirable. Protect yourself by using your victim's love and admiration as a shield.
4. *Davor (M) the Utilitarian*: Keep on existing by putting on the facade of a do-gooder and try to minimize the impact of your monstrous nature. Survive by being loved by a group or community convinced of your good intentions and the help of like-minded individuals.
5. *Hera (F) the Rebel*: Keep on existing by letting none stand in the way of your goals, fighting when necessary, and not trying to hide from them your true nature. Protect yourself from attacks by overcoming your opponents with physical/supernatural strength or cunning.
6. *Maverick (M) The apolitical*: Keep on existing by staying out of conflicts and fights with others. Dedicate yourself to a cause worth of your existence. Protect yourself by being always on the move and never allowing yourself to be found.
