# Physical Attributes

- Name: Indie
- Born Gender: F
- Possibly a [diminutive](https://www.behindthename.com/glossary/view/diminutive) of [India](https://www.behindthename.com/name/india) or [Indiana](https://www.behindthename.com/name/indiana), but also likely inspired by the term _indie_, short for _independent_, which is typically used to refer to media produced outside of the mainstream.

# Subconscious

## The Negative Experience

- Physically and mentally abused by her father.
- Neglected by her mother.
- Ran away to live on the streets.
- Had many foster parents. The last good. All the others were bad.

## The Core Motivation

To Prevent:
- Being hurt by others, physically or mentally.
- Depending on others that may hurt you to survive.
- Being without a home.

I Must:
- Trust no one.
- Be careful not to develop feelings for others.
- Be independent of everyone. Have your own means of survival.
- Build a castle and high walls to keep strangers and intruders out.

# Conscious

## The Stated Belief (Lie)

There are two types of people in the world: Those that disappointed you and those that will do so in the future. Anyone that does not see that is either dumb or naive.

Since all are untrustworthy, there is no point in getting close to anyone. The best thing to do is take care of the one person you can trust: Yourself.

## Areas of Their Life

### Goals

- Depend on no one for her survival.
- Gain as much knowledge as possible. This helps you depend on no one.
- Don't let anyone hurt you.

### Relationships

- Avoid at all costs.
- Interact only the mminimumrequired with others.
- Never let your guard down

### Lifestyle

- Frugal and practical.
- Lives in a small apartment provided by the Uni. Does not need any more than that.
- Low profile. People cannot bother what they cannot see.

### Presentation

- Wears a Mohawk.
- Prefers dark or gray large hoodies, baggy and ragged jeans with dirty black converses or Dr. Martens.
- Heavy, dark eyeliner.
- Chain smokes.
- "Dirty" and ragged, smells slightly, but not too bad.

### Dialogue

- Speaks calmly and slowly. Not at snail pace, but not in a hurry to go somewhere.
- Asks more questions than answers and usually answers a question with another question.
- Observant. Prefers to look around the scene than to talk people ears off. Stays quiet if she doesn't have anything relevant to say

### Weaknesses

- Deeply disturbed by familial scenes, for example, seeing a father and a girl child playing together in a public playground.
- Stubborn and set in her own ways. Difficult to persuade.
- Pushes people out, even those that seek to help her.
- Quick to anger if pressed about topics she hates: Family and relationships, or trust in general.

## [The Dilemma](setting_and_themes.md#^476916)

- Keep on existing by isolating yourself.
- Do not make your presence known to your victims.
- Protect yourself from attacks by not being known and by disappearing from view if the need arises (going under the radar forever is an option).
