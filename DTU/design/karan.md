# Subconscious

## The Negative Experience

- Born poor.
- Forced to live in the slums.
- Grew up seeing friends die because they became criminals to survive.
- Grew up seeing the rich and powerful being successful and screw him over.

## The Core Motivation

To prevent:

- Being powerless.
- Having no real choice of my own in my life.

I must:

- I will never again be told what to do.
- No opportunity will ever be out of my reach again.
- I will be no one else's tools.

# Conscious

The world consists of two groups: Winners and losers. Tools and those that use them. If you are not one, you are nothing but the other.
