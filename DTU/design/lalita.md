# Physical Attributes

- Name: Lalita
- Born Gender: F
- Means "playful, charming, desirable" in Sanskrit. In Hindu belief this is the name of one of the playmates of the young [Krishna](https://www.behindthename.com/name/krishna). It is also another name of the goddess [Parvati](https://www.behindthename.com/name/parvati).

# Subconscious

## The Negative Experience

- Second sister. Constantly bullied by her older sister for being "ugly" (she and her sister are all beautiful women).
- Constantly incentivized to compete with her sister by her mother and father. Failure ment denial of love by parents.
- Forced to model and work as an actress from an early age.
- Humiliated by in a beauty contest when she was a teenager. Was told she could not win because she was "too fat". She was not.

## The Core Motivation

To Prevent:
- Being unwanted.
- Being unloved.
- Being called ugly.
- Being "second place".

I Must:
- Be the most attractive person in every situation.
- Be loved at all costs. Manipulate the feelings of others as necessary.
- Never allow anyone to diminish your beauty.
- Never lose any competition to another. This includes loosing friends, lovers, or just the attention of the room from myself.

# Conscious

## The Stated Belief (Lie)

Some people are ugly. That is not being rude, that is just fact. And it is also a fact that ugly people don't get their way. That hot person you want to hook up with? They won't be crying your soul across the dance floor to see if you deserve a shot, They want someone *hot*. 

That job you really want but are not that qualified for? Well, if you are ugly people will dump you without a second thought. If you are hot tough? You can persuade them to have your way. Again, this is just a *fact*. Everyone treats beautiful people better. Thankfully, *I* am the hottest in the room. *In every room*.

## [The Dilemma](setting_and_themes.md#^476916)

- Keep on existing by convincing others you are a beautiful (and thus good monster).
- Make your victims accept your monstrous nature as godhood. Convince them that you are desirable superior and deserves to be served as a goddess.
- Protect yourself by using your victim's love and admiration as a shield, or making your worshippers your cannon fodder.
