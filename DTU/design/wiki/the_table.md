The *Tabula Seniorum*, meaning "The Board of Elders" is the faction formed by some of the eldest vampires in the world. They seek to safeguard their existence by protecting their interests and remaining a subtle power manipulation in human society. Often these vampires occupy high political positions or are influential business owners. It is commonly known as "The Table"

Members of the faction refer to each other as "Knights" while members outside the faction commonly refer to Table members as "stools". This is done in mockery and intends to reflect the fact that members of the Table are often not the knights of the Table, but the stools used by the true Knights to sit upon.
