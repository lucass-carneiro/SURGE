# Conscious

## The Stated Belief (Lie)

There are two types of people in the world: Those that disappointed you and those that will do so in the future. Anyone that does not see that is either dumb or naive.

Since all are untrustworthy, there is no point in getting close to anyone. The best thing to do is take care of the one person you can trust: Yourself.

This extends to skills and getting the job done: If you want something done right, do it yourself. Rely only on your own skills, as other people will *surely* become unavailable in the future. It is only a matter of time.
