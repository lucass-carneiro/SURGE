# Physical Attributes

- Born Gender: F
- Age: 50

# Behind the Name

Possibly from Greek _[ἰσμή](https://www.behindthename.com/support/transcribe?type=GR&target=i%29smh%27) (isme)_ meaning "knowledge". This was the name of the daughter of Oedipus and Jocasta in Greek legend.

# Subconscious

## The Negative Experience

Single event or pattern of bad things happening.
This is specific, but so bad that the character created a coping mechanism to deal with absolutely *everything else*.

## The Core Motivation

A comping mechanism for the bad thing.

*"To prevent this from affecting me again, I must..."*

This is a general (and wrong) solution to the specific trauma problem. The generalization of the solution to the specific trauma problem trickles down to *all* areas of the character life. In other words, the core motivation is an overcorrection on the character's part. Realizing and changing this is often called an *arch*.

To Prevent:
- A

I Must:
- B

# Conscious

## The Stated Belief (Lie)

Unhealthy people (almost everyone that is worth telling a story about) aren't conscious of the fact that their beliefs are coping mechanisms, so they create a *narrative* to justify the core belief.

When asked "Why are you like this?" characters will deffer to this belief and not to their core motivation. Whatever helps a character sleep at night.

## Areas of Their Life

The core belief affects *all areas of a character's life*.
Filling the areas below with "doesn't care" **IS** valid

### Goals
### Relationships
### Lifestyle
### Dialogue
### Weaknesses
