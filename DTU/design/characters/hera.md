# Subconscious

## The Negative Experience

- Mother has died when she was 7
- Left with her father, who loved her but was too stern and strict.
- Father would often beat and punish her for misbehaving or even the smallest deviation of what he considered to be acceptable
- This made her shy, introspective and sad child.

## The Core Motivation

To Prevent:
- Being beaten.
- Being hurt by who I love.
- Being controlled.
- Being shamed out of who I truly am.
- Being unable to protect those I care about

I Must:
- Physically overpower my opponents.
- Never let anyone lay a finger on me and walk.
- Never let anyone who tries to control me do so and walk away without beat down.
- Shut the voices that want to silence who I am by kicking their teeth in and feeding them to their tongues.

# Conscious

## The Stated Belief (Lie)

Some say knowledge is power. I say that power is power. You see, no nerd feels so powerful anymore when you are beating them down with their own books. Projecting *raw strength* and *fear* of what that strength might do to your soft tissue: this is the *true* root of all power. That is why nations are building nukes to this day.

Some people don't like this truth, but the truth is that Humans are violent animals. We get ahead by beating the other monkey in the head until they are *dead*. That is natural selection. I'm just an agent of Darwin, and I'm making damn sure that I'm the monkey with the *heavier* stick.
