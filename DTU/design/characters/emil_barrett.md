- Born Gender: M
- Age: 46

# Behind the Name

Emil: From the Roman family name _Aemilius_, which was derived from Latin _aemulus_ meaning "rival".

Barrett: From a surname probably meaning "quarrelsome, deceptive" in Middle English, originally given to a quarrelsome person.

# Subconscious

## The Negative Experience

- Became a vampire against his will.
- Had threats made to his family by his lord if he disobeyed him
- Was prohibited from seeing or caring for his loved ones (wife and children)

## The Core Motivation

To be able to see my wife and children again, I must

- Destroy any and all who would stop me.
- Destroy all who would control me.
- Acquire power to defend myself and to be free of all tyranny, including the tyranny of the sun and the tyranny of vampiric hunger.

# Conscious

## The Stated Belief (Lie)

The ends do justify the means, if the cause is just. I want nothing more than to see my wife and my children again, and I will go to any lengths necessary, do anything that I must and kill anyone that stands in my way to achieve this.

I will never again allow anyone to stop me or to control me. I *will* have my life back at any cost.

## Areas of Their Life

### Goals

- Find a way to control my vampiric hunger
- Find a way to walk during the daylight.
- Reunite with my family

### Relationships

- Cares only for his family.
- Only interacts with people that can bring him closer to his goals.
- Does not wish to form attachments or connections in vampiric society. In fact, he works to actively reject the society of the night

- Lives in his lair, isolated from all vampires.
- Dedicates all of his hours to obsessively studying occult books.
- Frugal. Has only the necessary. Everything else is superfluous.
- Only leaves his lair to feed, perform rituals or search for occult books

### Dialogue

- Speaks calmly.
- When discussing occult knowledge, he talks like an university professor.
- Does not like to speak about things other than his family and saving them.

### Weaknesses

- His love for his family is his greatest weak spot.
- Is blinded by his goals.
- Can be extremely vindictive if he perceivesthat people are trying to fool or control him
