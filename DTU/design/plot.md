# Plot Threads

DTU will have several concurrent plot threads running. The game is completed when each of these plots is completed by the #PC. In order of priority, the plot points of DTU are:

1. *Find your Lord*: One of the [Characters](index.md#^973a23) has murdered you and turned you. You have to find out who and why they did that.
2. *Get educated and find your faction*: The characters will offer you help and advice (according to their own interests and perspectives on the larger setting).  This advice may help or hinder you, depending on the tutor's ulterior motives and faction. Information may be given impartially or with debatable degree of trust (sometimes outright lies may be told to the #PC). Decide with whom you agree and who do you want to ally yourself with.
3. *The Inquisition*: News from the city are troubling. There are reports of vampire hunters and they are out for blood. Your blood. You were turned to turn the tide in taking over the campus for a specific faction, and you are going to have to decide the best way to keep them out of campus and from destroying you.
