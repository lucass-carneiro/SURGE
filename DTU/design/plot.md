# Main Plot

The #PC is a freshman student at DCU. While attending one of its infamous parties, a masquerade rave, the #PC attracts the attention of more than their crushes: A mysterious vampire, an undead creature of the night, sees the #PC as the first piece in a scheme that they have been putting in motion for some time.

The mysterious vampire seduces the #PC and leads them away from the party. The #PC gets knocked out unconscious by the mysterious stranger, and when they wake up, they find themselves in a grim situation.

No longer on the party, or even on campus, the #PC finds themselves in a nightmarish scenario: They were completely naked, tied in an X shape to a rack on a wall and gagged.  The room, looks like a basement, is dimly with red and black candles and is covered in occult symbols drawn with blood.

The mysterious stranger from the party approaches the #PC with a large ceremonial dagger, adorned with jewels and covered in dry blood. The stranger begins to recite an ancient ritual in Latin. The candles and symbols in the room begin to radiate. In the climax of the ritual, the stranger sticks the knife squarely in the #PC's gut and begins to slowly but surely eviscerating them. Fade to black.

The #PC wakes up scared. In front of him is [Indie](indie.md). She informs the #PC that she is not a threat and that they have, in fact, died at the hands of the mysterious stranger. She found the #PC's almost lifeless body dumped in a dark corner on campus. Not only that, but she immediately knew we were the latest victim of the stranger's crimes. Because the #PC was almost dead and there was no hope of bringing them to life, #Indie decided to give us [The Kiss](wiki/the_kiss), turning us into a vampire, thus "saving us". She did this not out of love, but hoping that we would be angry enough to help her catch the stranger who did this to you.
