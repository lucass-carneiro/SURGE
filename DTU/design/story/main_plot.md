# Hook

The #PC is unaware of the existance of the cult. They attend a party on campus wanting nothing more than to have fun. The university campus is presented and the setting of the modern world is established through interactions between the #PC and various #NPCs at the party.

# Turn 1

After the party, the #PC gets kidnapped and murdered as a sacrifice for the cult. After being used in the sacrifice, their almost dead body is dumped somewhere on campus. The #Companion finds the #PC's almost dead body and gives the #PC [The Kiss](wiki/the_kiss.md) to save them, primarily out of a desire to use them to stop the cult.

# Pinch 1

While the #PC was recuperating from [The Kiss](wiki/the_kiss.md), another victim of the cult is found by the companion in the [Revenants](wiki/the_revenants) territory. After investigating the scene, the #PC and the companion talk to the local #RevenantLeader, who theorize that the murder is a ploy by the local [Table Members](wiki/the_table.md) seeking to destabilize the [Revenant](wiki/the_revenants.md) rule in the region by calling their ability to keep things under control into question. Visiting the local [Table](wiki/the_table.md) chapters, the #PC is told that this accusation is a ruse by the local [Revenants](wiki/the_revenants.md), trying to play victims to destabilize the [Table's](wiki/the_revenants.md) control of campus. Nevertheless, the #TableLeader tells the #PC that there is an [Unbound](wiki/the_unbound.md) vampire who is a master of the occult. This character is the #Scribe. The #TableLeader points the #PC to the last known location of the #Scribe with the condition that, in return, the #PC informs the #TableLeader of the #Scribe's location if they are found. The #PC can accept this, lying that they will provide the location of the scribe, telling the truth but providing a false location or telling the truth and providing the correct location at a later point in time.

# Midpoint

The #PC interacts with the #Scribe and discovers that the rituals being performed by the cult were described in occult literature. They discover that the ritual's primary objective is to allow a vampire to walk during the day. Optionally, the #Scribe and the #PC may work together to further discover the truth that the ritual has been previously attempted several times and only worked once, exacting the heavy toll of transforming the vampire into a *specter*, an incorporeal being that is able to walk during the light but never able to interact with the physical world.

# Pinch 2

With the knowledge of what the #CultLeader seeks, the #PC, and the #Scribe determine when and where the next killing will take place. The #PC is able to catch the #CultLeader as they murder another victim. The #PC and the #Companion chases the #CultLeader into the university's water tower. Atop the tower, the #CultLeader reveals their motivations are "good": They simply wish to reunite with their family and believe that their ends justify their means. The #CultLeader escapes the #PC and the #Companion, who are left clueless to where the #CultLeader makes his lair.

# Turn 2

The #Scribe contacts the #PC and asks them to come visit. The #Scribe informs the #PC that they discovered that it is possible to track the #CultLeader by the leftover magic resonance from the ritual sites where the bodies were found. By now, these places were cleaned up, but the #Scribe tells the #PC that the #TableLeader possess an artifact known as the [Dark Lantern](wiki/dark_lantern.md), which allows one to amplify latent magical energy in a location. The #TableLeader will ask for the location of the #Scribe. The player can choose to lie, convince, fight (with optional help from the #RevenantLeader) or steal the item from the #TableLeader. After going through all the places where victims were found, including the #PC's, the #PC is able to triangulate the location of the #CultLeader Lair. The #PC and the #Companion, venture into the Cult's lair to dismantle their operation or take the #CultLeader's place.

# Resolution

The #CultLeader is defeated. Possible endings are
1. The #PC kills the #CultLeader and tries to complete the ritual to take power to themselves. The #PC dies, as the ritual does not work.
2. The #PC kills the #CultLeader and destroys the cult's HQ, along with all the evidence of their existence.
3. The #PC makes the #CultLeader suicide, by presenting evidence that the ritual does not work as intended by the #CultLeader. This is only possible if the player has worked with the #Scribe to discover this.
4. The #PC sneaks in the #CultLeader's lair and places a potent incendiary device, who destroys the building immediately, along with all evidence of the cult. This is only possible if the #PC is in good terms with the #Fighter.
5. The #PC joins the cult leader in their quest, but is later betrayed when the cult leaders uses the #PC as the final sacrifice needed for the ritual. The #CultLeader fails to perform the ritual and dies horribly.
