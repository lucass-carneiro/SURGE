# Hook

The #PC is unaware of the existance of the cult. They attend a party on campus wanting nothing more than to have fun. The university campus is presented and the setting of the modern world is established through interactions between the #PC and various #NPCs at the party.

# Turn 1

After the party, the #PC gets kidnapped and murdered as a sacrifice for the cult. After being used in the sacrifice, their almost dead body is dumped somewhere on campus. The #Companion finds the #PC's almost dead body and gives the #PC [The Kiss](wiki/the_kiss.md) to save them, primarily out of a desire to use them to stop the cult.

# Pinch 1

While the #PC was recuperating from [The Kiss](wiki/the_kiss.md), another victim of the cult is found by the companion in the [Revenants](wiki/the_revenants) territory. After investigating the scene, the #PC and the companion talk to the local #RevenantLeader, who theorize that the murder is a ploy by the local [Table Members](wiki/the_table.md) seeking to destabilize the [Revenant](wiki/the_revenants.md) rule in the region by calling their ability to keep things under control into question.

Visiting the local [Table](wiki/the_table.md) chapters, the #PC is told that this accusation is a ruse by the local [Revenants](wiki/the_revenants.md), trying to play victims to destabilize the [Table's](wiki/the_revenants.md) control of campus. Nevertheless, the #TableLeader tells the #PC that there is an [Unbound](wiki/the_unbound.md) vampire who is a master of the occult. This character is the #Scribe.

The #TableLeader points the #PC to the last known location of the #Scribe with the condition that, in return, the #PC informs the #TableLeader of the #Scribe's location if they are found. The #PC can accept this, lying that they will provide the location of the scribe, telling the truth but providing a false location or telling the truth and providing the correct location at a later point in time.

# Try and Fail 1

The #Scribe is not at the last known location. The #PC and the #Companion discover clues that the #Scribe is somewhere called [The Mirror Maze](wiki/the_mirror_maze.md). The #Companion has heard of that before when talking to the #RevenantLeader.

The #PC and the #Companion will ask the #RevenantLeader about it. The #RevenantLeader will also attempt to strike a bargain with the #PC. The leader is willing to help the #PC, provided that the #PC in turn help the [Revenants](wiki/the_revenants.md) navigate the [Mirror Maze](wiki/the_mirror_maze.md) and contact the #Scribe, instead of revealing the #Scribe's location to the #TableLeader 

The #RevenantLeader redirects the party to [Wilhelm](npcs.md#Wilhelm), who tells the party he can help them enter the maze, but first the #PC needs to recover a [Shadow Key](wiki/shadow_key.md) from some [Unbound](wiki/the_unbound.md) vampire bikers that live on the outskirts of campus. Once that is done, the #PC enters and navigates the [Maze](wiki/the_mirror_maze.md) and finds the #Scribe 

# Midpoint

The #PC interacts with the #Scribe and discovers that the rituals being performed by the cult were described in occult literature. They discover that the ritual's primary objective is to allow a vampire to walk during the day.

Optionally, the #PC may help the #Scribe to find [Grimoire Das All](wiki/grimorie_das_all.md) a book in the library inside [The Mirror Maze](wiki/the_mirror_maze.md). If the #PC agrees, the #Scribe will be able to do further research in the ritual and discover important information that will be available later on.

# Pinch 2 + Try and Fail 2

With the knowledge of what the #CultLeader seeks, the #PC, and the #Scribe determine when and where the next killing will likely take place. The #PC is able to catch the #CultLeader as they murder another victim.

The #PC and the #Companion chases the #CultLeader into the university's water tower. Atop the tower, the #CultLeader reveals their motivations are "good": They simply wish to reunite with their family and believe that their ends justify their means. A fight ensues. The #CultLeader escapes the #PC and the #Companion, who are left clueless to where the #CultLeader makes his lair or when and where he will complete his ritual.

All leads have been exhausted and the trail of the #CultLeader goes cold. Too weeks pass, with the #PC and the #Companion living together and fruitlessly scouring the campus and avoiding both the [Revenants](wiki/the_revenants.md) and [Table](wiki/the_table.md), who want them to reveal the location of the #Scribe.

# Turn 2

The #Scribe contacts the #PC and asks them to come visit. The #Scribe informs the #PC that they discovered that it is possible to track the #CultLeader by the leftover magic resonance from the ritual sites where the bodies were found. By now, these places were cleaned up, but the #Scribe tells the #PC that the #TableLeader possess an artifact known as the [Dark Lantern](wiki/dark_lantern.md), which allows one to amplify latent magical energy in a location.

The #TableLeader will ask for the location of the #Scribe. The player can choose to lie, convince, fight (with optional help from the #RevenantLeader, who will also help if they are given the location of the #Scribe) or steal the item from the #TableLeader.

Once the [Dark Lantern](wiki/dark_lantern.md) has been obtained, if the #PC can convince the #Scribe that they have not betrayed their location to the #TableLeader or to the #RevenantLeader and the #PC helped the #Scribe earlier by finding the [Grimoire Das All](grimorie_das_all.md) the #Scribe reveals to the #PC that she learned that the ritual the #CultLeader is about to perform has been previously attempted several times and only worked once in recorded occult history. The ritual deliver its promise of allowing the vampire to cure their hunger and walk during the day by transforming the vampire into a *specter*, an incorporeal being unable to interact with the physical world. The #CultLeader probably does not know that, but if he is successful, his goal with reuniting with his family will still be beyond his reach

The #Scribe gives the #PC a map that has to be used in conjunction with the [Dark Lantern](wiki/dark_lantern.md). After going through all the places where victims were found, including the #PC's, the #PC is able to triangulate the location of the #CultLeader Lair. 

The #PC and the #Companion, venture into the Cult's lair to dismantle their operation or take the #CultLeader's place. The party can ask from help from both the #RevenantLeader and the #TableLeader, which may decide to send an #NPC to help out, depending on their disposition towards the  player.

# Resolution

The #CultLeader is defeated. Possible endings are
1. The #PC kills the #CultLeader and tries to complete the ritual to take power to themselves. The #PC dies, as the ritual does not work.
2. The #PC kills the #CultLeader and destroys the cult's HQ, along with all the evidence of their existence.
3. The #PC makes the #CultLeader suicide, by presenting evidence that the ritual does not work as intended by the #CultLeader. This is only possible if the player has worked with the #Scribe to discover this.
4. The #PC sneaks in the #CultLeader's lair and places a potent incendiary device, who destroys the building immediately, along with all evidence of the cult. This is only possible if the #PC is in good terms with the #Fighter.
5. The #PC joins the cult leader in their quest, but is later betrayed when the cult leaders uses the #PC as the final sacrifice needed for the ritual. The #CultLeader fails to perform the ritual and dies horribly.
