# TODO
* []
* [] Add Mesh drawing support
* [] Add vm hooks for sending vertex data to OpenGL from the vm
* [] Add vm hooks to opengl shapes and shape transformations
* [] Make shaders read SPIRV files (available in OpenGL 4.6)
* [] Thread allocators are not getting destroyed. Investigate.
* [] Find out safer way to provide VM index from the lua state.

# Done
* [x] Review file loading to memory functions. Implement: load to buffer, ~load given allocator~
* [x] Implement do_file_at with more granularity
* [x] Implement safety net in lua_log_message with try catch.
* [x] Implement more log functions.
* [X] Find out the VM index from the lua state.
* [x] Review image loader
* [x] Create stack-backed static allocator.
* [x] Allow stack allocator to free out of order using the stack backed allocator.
* [x] Add VM hooks to load and drop images.
* [x] Review opengl buffer arrays
* [x] Load shaders in vm.
* [x] Add vm hooks for shaders: Compiling and using
